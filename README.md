# weather-demo
A small SwiftUI demo project using OpenWeather that I used in a SwiftUI introductory talk.

The main purpose was highlighting Swift features and how SwiftUI lets us create apps without much hassle. Some features are basic, 
and some things are hardcoded/not in the correct place, but that was done just to save time while presenting the demo.

To run this, just open it using Xcode, put your API token in `WeatherFetcher.swift` and go! No extra setup required.
